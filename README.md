# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Articles

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using Python by extracting article content from various web sources. It leverages the newspaper3k library to scrape and summarize online articles and uses TextBlob for natural language processing and sentiment polarity scoring.

## Project Overview
The notebook automates the process of:

Extracting articles from URLs (Wikipedia, Yahoo News, etc.)

Summarizing content using NLP

Analyzing sentiment using TextBlob

Comparing sentiment polarity scores across different sources and custom text files

Sentiment Scoring
Each article or text is given a sentiment polarity score between -1 (very negative) and +1 (very positive), with 0 being neutral.

## Tools and Libraries
Python 3.x

newspaper3k – for web scraping and article parsing

nltk – for tokenization (used by newspaper3k)

TextBlob – for sentiment analysis

Jupyter Notebook – for interactive exploration

## Sample Use Cases
Compare how different news articles report on a topic and their sentiment bias.

Analyze personal documents or notes for overall sentiment.

Build foundational knowledge for more complex NLP applications.
